Healthcare Data Analysis

Healthcare data analysis is a dynamic field that harnesses the power of data to extract meaningful insights, drive informed decision-making, and enhance the overall quality of healthcare delivery. In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the vast amount of data generated presents both challenges and opportunities. Analyzing this data allows healthcare professionals to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform critical decisions, improve patient outcomes, and optimize operational efficiency.
Structured Query Language (SQL) stands out as a fundamental tool in healthcare data analysis. With its ability to query and manipulate databases, SQL enables professionals to efficiently retrieve and analyze relevant information from healthcare datasets. From patient records and treatment histories to administrative and operational data, the application of SQL in healthcare data analysis facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions within the healthcare system.
Data Source: Synthea - Simulating Real-world Healthcare Patterns 
Synthea, an open-source educational tool, provides a simulated patient database, emulating an electronic medical records system. The data generated by Synthea is designed to model real-world patterns observed in individuals dealing with various diseases and their corresponding hospital visits.

Dataset Overview: Females Health Data
This specific dataset focuses on female health, comprising information on encounters, immunization, and conditions. The dataset includes:
1.	Patient Details – Patient ID, Name, Marital status, Gender, Address, City 
2.	Immunization – Description of vaccines, code
3.	Encounter – The dataset appears to represent healthcare encounters, with each row representing a specific encounter, costs, providers, payers, and start-stop date
4.	Condition – Diagnosis of patient’s condition, start and stop date of condition, patient ID
   
Exploration & Tools:
I am using the SQL server Management tool to uncover the objectives of this analysis. Here are the SQL commands and statements used in this project,

•	DISTINCT
•	HAVING
•	Merging columns in tables with JOINS
•	Combining rows with UNION
•	SUBQUERIES 
•	CASE WHEN
•	GROUP BY
•	 ORDER BY
