Healthcare data analysis is a dynamic field that harnesses the power of data to extract meaningful insights, drive informed decision-making, and enhance the overall quality of healthcare delivery. In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the vast amount of data generated presents both challenges and opportunities. Analyzing this data allows healthcare professionals to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform critical decisions, improve patient outcomes, and optimize operational efficiency.
Structured Query Language (SQL) stands out as a fundamental tool in healthcare data analysis. With its ability to query and manipulate databases, SQL enables professionals to efficiently retrieve and analyze relevant information from healthcare datasets. From patient records and treatment histories to administrative and operational data, the application of SQL in healthcare data analysis facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions within the healthcare system.

Problem statement –
1.	Calculate distinct marital statuses and their respective counts of the patients

select distinct MARITAL,count(*) as count
from patients
group by MARITAL
order by count(*) desc

result-
MARITAL  count
M		4640
\N		3682
S		1549
D		1162
W		330

Key finding- The majority of female patients attending the hospital are married


2.	 Calculate the average age and count of patients based on their marital status
Select MARITAL, AVG(DATEDIFF(YEAR, BIRTHDATE, GETDATE()) - 
        CASE 
            WHEN (MONTH(BIRTHDATE) > MONTH(GETDATE()) OR (MONTH(BIRTHDATE) = MONTH(GETDATE()) AND DAY(BIRTHDATE) > DAY(GETDATE())))
            THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS avg_age,
    COUNT(*) AS count
from patients
GROUP BY MARITAL
ORDER BY count DESC;

result-
MARITAL	avg_age	count
M		55		4640
\N		17		3682
S		57		1549
D		62		1162
W		65		330
Key finding- 4640 female patients attending the hospital are married
and they have an average age of 55

3.	Types of Encounter class and number of patients in each class
select ENCOUNTERCLASS, count(ENCOUNTERCLASS) as Count
from encounters
group by ENCOUNTERCLASS
order by count(ENCOUNTERCLASS) desc
